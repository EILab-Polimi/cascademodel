## CASCADE toolbox : a framework for network-scale sediment connectivity assessment

[CASCADE_toolbox](https://cascademodel.wordpress.com/) is an open source MATLAB™ toolbox for the application of the CASCADE model.

[CASCADE](https://cascademodel.wordpress.com/about-cascade/) (CAtchment Sediment Connectivity And DElivery) is a flexible modelling framework for the simulation of river sediment transport and connectivity. 
It also allows for the integration of dams and barriers as well as for consideration of external sediment contribution to the network. 

Applications include impact assessment of dam portfolios, localization of dominant sources of sediment for downstream river reaches and visualization of basin-scale sediment connectivity under alternative sediment management strategies. 
The toolbox is equipped with interactive visualization tools for displaying the model outputs and exploring the alteration caused by disturbances. 

## Requirements

CASCADE toolbox requires MATLAB™ R2017b or newer, with the Text Analytics Toolbox™ and the Bioinformatics Toolbox™.
For the river network extraction from a Digital Elevation Model, it is required the MATLAB toolbox [TopoToolbox 2.2](https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/topotoolbox/).


## Documentation

CASCADE toolbox comes with an user guide for the implementation of the toolbox, fully commented code and interactive functions for first time users.
Refer to the user guide for more informations.
